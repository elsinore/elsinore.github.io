    <h1 align="center">Mechanical signals influence circadian clock genes in murine osteocytes: Implications for the spatial distribution of sclerostin</h1>
    <h6>ABSTRACT</h6>
    <p align="justify">
      Mechanical signals control bone metabolism and strongly regulate the expression of sclerostin, an osteocyte-expressed negative regulator of bone formation. Nevertheless, the identification of regulatory elements for underlying mechano-induced signal transduction in osteocytes remains unclear. We investigated the changes in the spatial distribution of sclerostin during orthodontic tooth movement (OTM) and screened out possible regulatory mechanisms using a bioinformatics analysis. The profile of sclerostin in the alveolar bone was analyzed based on the percentage of sclerostin-positive cells, histograms of the gray levels, and the mean power frequency (MPF) derived from the fast Fourier transform. The gene expression profiles of GSE42874 were obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database to screen out possible mechanisms. In addition, an in vitro study was performed to validate the results of the bioinfomatics analysis. During OTM, the spatial distribution of sclerostin was changed in a certain pattern. Spearmanâ€™s rho and multiple linear regression showed that the percentage of sclerostin-positive cells was associated with the MPF of its spatial distribution profile. The differentially expressed genes from GSE42874 that were enriched in GO biological process terms were mainly associated with biological processes related to the immune response and the circadian rhythm. The expression levels of core circadian clock genes (Clock, Bmal1, Per1, Per2, Per3, Cry1 and Cry2) were dramatically decreased in osteocytic MLO-Y4 cells that were compressed by static force; however, only <i>Per2</i>, <i>Per3</i> and <i>Cry1</i> were decreased in MLO-Y4 cells cocultured with compressed human periodontal ligament (PDL) cells. Our findings indicated that OTM induced a change in the spatial distribution of sclerostin, and that this may have a biological function. Cross-talk between PDL cells and osteocytes had an impact on the mechanical force-induced change in the expression of core circadian clock genes in osteocytes.
