    <h1 align="center">Bioinformatics analysis shows candidate genes for osteocytes differentially response to different types of mechanical stimuli</h1>
    <h6>ABSTRACT</h6>
    <p align="justify">
      <b>Objective</b>: This study aimed to predict the key genes and pathways that are activated when different types of mechanical loading (high gravity and shear force) are applied to osteocytes.
      <br><b>Method</b>: The gene expression profiles were obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. Two-fold gravity of Earth-treated and gravity of Earth-treated murine long bone osteocyte Y4 (MLO-Y4) cell-line samples of GSE62128 (Set1), 2-hour fluid flow-treated and 2-hour sham-treated MLO-Y4 samples of GSE42874 (Set2), and Sost & Sostdc1 gene knockout and wild-type ex vivo osteocyte samples of GSE44325 (Set3) were used in the present study. The GEO2R web application was used to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Functional enrichment analyses were performed for Set1 and Set2. The common DEGs between Set3 vs Set1, Set3 vs Set2, and Set1 vs Set2 were considered as key DEGs, then a protein-protein interactions (PPI) network was constructed using the minimal nodes from the DEGs that were common between Set1 and Set2 at the level of P&lt;0.05, which linked most of the key DEGs.
      <br><b>Results</b>: Both Set1 and Set2 DEGs were enriched in the oxidation-reduction process but different signal pathways were enriched. The common DEGs across Set1 and Set2 showed opposite expression patterns. The PPI network was enriched in several pathways relative to energy metabolism and hypoxia.
      <br><b>Conclusions</b>: Our findings indicated that high gravity and fluid flow led to different biological processes in MLO-Y4, and hypoxia and energy metabolism might have an important role for osteocytes differentially response to different types of mechanical stimuli.
